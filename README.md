# CodeGenerator

This project stands under a course project called CodeGen.
Using T5, Hugging Face, and C4 to develop a model capable of generating Python code from user commands.
By leveraging T5's text-to-text framework and Hugging Face's pre-trained models, I trained the model on a dataset from C4 to understand user commands and produce corresponding Python code. This project aims to streamline the process of translating natural language commands into executable Python code, potentially improving the accessibility of programming for non-experts.
